Implementation of a CNN in PyTorch

This is just a simple implementation of a convolutional neural network for testing the effects of various weight distributions and randomness in the network.

I log a lot of information to evaluate how the network is doing after every epoch and I output images of the loss over time along with the train/test accuracy.
